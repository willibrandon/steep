## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- 8 user stories covering P1 (core editor, results), P2 (highlighting, transactions, keyboard), and P3 (history, snippets, export)
- 36 functional requirements organized by priority
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific performance targets
- Edge cases cover error handling, large datasets, connection issues, and read-only mode
